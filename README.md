# deep.docs
deep.ditch repository for housing documentation. I don't think this repository should necessarily be code documentation (code docs should probably be included in the repo with the code). Instead, I'd like this repo to contain general project and team organization info. 

# About deep.ditch
Before governments can repair road damage, they first must be aware of the presence of road damage. The process of locating and identifying road damage requires manual inspection, expensive sensors, specialty vehicles, or public reports. Many of these methods are either cost prohibitive, slow, or ineffective.

deep.ditch attempts to solve this problem using recent advancements in compter vision and deep learning. We plan to train a computer vision model to detect road damage. Mobile devices running our model could then be dash mounted in government vehicles to automatically report road damage. Using the data reported by our model government officials would be able to make appropriate and timely responses.
